He lay on his armour-like back, and if he lifted his head a little he could see his brown belly, slightly domed and divided by arches into stiff sections. The bedding was hardly able to cover <strong>strong</strong> it and seemed ready to slide off any moment. His many legs, pitifully thin compared with the size of the rest of him, <a class="external ext" href="#">link</a> waved about helplessly as he looked. "What's happened to me? " he thought. It wasn't a dream. His room, a proper human room although a little too small, lay peacefully between its four familiar walls.</p><h1>One morning, when Gregor Samsa woke from troubled dreams.</h1><h2>The bedding was hardly able to cover it.</h2><p>It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.</p><h2>The bedding was hardly able to cover it.</h2><p>It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.</p><ul><li>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet consectetuer.</li><li>Aenean commodo ligula eget dolor.</li><li>Aenean massa cum sociis natoque penatibus.</li></ul><p>It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.</p><form action="#" method="post"><fieldset><label for="name">Name:</label><input type="text" id="name" placeholder="Enter yourfull name"><label for="email">Email:</label><input type="email" id="email" placeholder="Enteryour email address"><label for="message">Message:</label><textarea id="message" placeholder="What's on yourmind?"></textarea><input type="submit" value="Send message"></fieldset></form><p>It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.</p><table class="data"><tr><th>Entry Header 1</th><th>Entry Header 2</th><th>Entry Header 3</th><th>Entry Header 4</th></tr><tr><td>Entry First Line 1</td><td>Entry First Line 2</td><td>Entry First Line 3</td><td>Entry First Line 4</td></tr><tr><td>Entry Line 1</td><td>Entry Line 2</td><td>Entry Line 3</td><td>Entry Line 4</td></tr><tr><td>Entry Last Line 1</td><td>Entry Last Line 2</td><td>Entry Last Line 3</td><td>Entry Last Line 4</td></tr></table><p>It showed a lady fitted out with a fur hat and fur boa who sat upright, raising a heavy fur muff that covered the whole of her lower arm towards the viewer.</p>
